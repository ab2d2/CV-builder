  authorDescription: `I am a professional Software Engineer with experience in working in agile teams of various sizes.
   I have a big passion for building innovative and user-friendly software. I focus on industry standards and enjoy working at 
   the ground level with technologies. I am always determined to do independent research to find out the best solution and best
    practices for a technical problem. When implementing large software components, I get periodic inputs from peers. I mentor, 
    and code review those developers less experienced than me. I also provide recommendations on approaches to take.
  I have worked on agile software development projects and have experienced working on the different stages of software development 
  including requirements gathering, analysis, design, implementation and testing. I have good attention to detail which is complemented 
  by good communication skills. I am very willing to  work with technologies that I am not familiar with because I believe I am a good
   learner and very open- minded. I am  able to work effectively (with guidance) in areas outside my core competency i.e. as a  Tester,
    a BA, a Platform Engineer, etc.  I currently work as a frontend developer and mainly work with Javascript, Angular, NodeJS and React.`,
